# Overview

This session is on modeling and machine learning in R.  In the first part, we will build some predictive models using the Airbnb data set, including Linear Regression, LASSO, and CART models.  In the second half, we will go over Natural Language Processing and Clustering.  

# Before the Session

First, `git pull` to ensure that you have the most up-to-date versions of all of the files for this course.  The pre-lecture assignment for this session is **pre-lecture-assignment-3.R**.  Please open the file, install the R packages there which are not already installed on your computer, and double-check that you obtain the same output as in **output-1.png** and **output-2.png**.

**Upload a screenshot of your final R Console to Stellar.**
