    "### Description\n",
    "Lazy constraints are useful when the full set of constraints is too large to explicitly include in the initial formulation. We might want to modify the MIP solution process such that when we have a new solution (for example with a heuristic or by solving a problem at a node in the branch-and-bound tree), we are given the opportunity to generate additional constraint(s). This allows us to generate them only upon demand, and stop the process based on our termination criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three important steps to providing a lazy constraint callback:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we must write a function that will analyze the current solution that takes a single argument, e.g. `mylazycongenerator(cb)`, where cb is a reference to the callback management code inside JuMP.\n",
    "2. do whatever analysis of the solution you need to inside your function to generate the new constraint before adding it to the model with `@lazyconstraint(cb, myconstraint)` (instead of the usual `@constraint(m, myconstraint)`).\n",
    "3. finally we notify JuMP that this function should be used for lazy constraint generation using the `addlazycallback(m, mylazycongenerator)` function before we call `solve(m)`.\n",
