It is also quite common to want to express logical constraints and implications, e.g. \"if this factory is built, we can build no other factories in this year\", or \"either factory A or factory B can be built, but not both\". The \"trick\" is expressing these logical constraints and implications as **linear inequalities**, and sometimes we need to introduce **auxiliary variables**.\n",
